### Application choice: Ruby E-Commerce with Ruby on Rails

A Ruby e-commerce project could involve building an online store from scratch using the Ruby on Rails framework. This would include creating models for products, categories, and users, along with functionalities for browsing products, adding items to a cart, and processing secure payments through integrations with payment gateways.

#### Some common steps in a CI setup include linting, testing, and building. What are the specific tools for taking care of these steps in the ecosystem of the language you picked? You can search for the answers by Google.

- *Linting*: [Rubocop](https://github.com/rubocop/rubocop) is a Ruby static code analyzer and code formatter. Out of the box it will enforce many of the guidelines outlined in the community Ruby Style Guide.
- *Testing*: [RSpec-Rails](https://github.com/rspec/rspec-rails) brings the RSpec testing framework to Ruby on Rails as a drop-in alternative to its default testing framework, Minitest. In RSpec, tests are not just scripts that verify your application code.
- *Building*: Ruby is an interpreted, high-level, general-purpose programming language. It was designed with an emphasis on programming productivity and simplicity. There is no need of a building step!


#### What alternatives are there to set up the CI besides Jenkins and GitHub Actions? Again, you can ask Google!
- *GitLab CI/CD*:  GitLab CI/CD offers a tightly integrated solution for building, testing, and deploying your code. It's known for its ease of use and tight integration with other GitLab features.
- *CircleCI*: A popular cloud-based CI/CD platform known for its scalability and ease of use. It offers a wide range of features and integrations with popular tools and services.
- *Azure Pipelines*: Azure Pipelines integrates well with other Azure services and provides a comprehensive CI/CD solution for projects in the Microsoft ecosystem.
- *Buildkite*: A self-hosted CI/CD server that offers a simple and lightweight solution. It's known for its focus on speed and performance.
- *AWS CodePipeline*: A cloud-based CI/CD service from Amazon Web Services that integrates well with other AWS services. It provides a visual interface for designing your CI/CD pipeline.

#### Would this setup be better in a self-hosted or a cloud-based environment? Why? What information would you need to make that decision?
In this scenario, a cloud-based environment would likely be a better fit. Cloud platforms offer affordable plans for easy scaling of resources like storage and processing power. Cloud platforms handle server maintenance and updates, freeing up the small development team to focus on core functionalities.

To make this decision one would consider the following factors:
- *Project size and complexity*: Larger or more complex projects with high traffic demands benefit more from cloud scalability.
- *Budget*: Cloud services can be cost-effective, but consider ongoing costs for resources.
- *Technical expertise*: If the team lacks experience managing servers, the cloud's ease of use is valuable.
